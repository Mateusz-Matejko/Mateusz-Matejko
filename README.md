Hi there! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Mateusz Matejko, a Master's graduate in Computer Science and Data Engineer at Bitpeak, where I’ve been working for over 2 years. My work focuses on building reliable data pipelines, scalable infrastructure, and clean data workflows.

⚙️ I'm especially passionate about Apache Spark and distributed data processing. I enjoy diving deep into complex technologies — once I learn something, I aim to truly master it. I learn fast, and I love challenging problems that require both precision and creativity.

🛠 My current stack:
Python & SQL

Apache Spark & Databricks

Azure Cloud

Docker for containerized development
